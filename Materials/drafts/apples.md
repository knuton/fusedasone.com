A strange thought.

The apple tree wants to spread its seed, wants to spread it so much in
fact, that it is willing to put considerable effort into producing
attractive and delicious fruit for animals to pick up and consume,
thereby moving the seed away from the tree.

The animals never cared about spreading the apple's seed, only ever
cared about the apple. Today we don't spread the seed of the apples we
consume to anywhere it can grow. But we take great care to keep good
trees alive and even to multiply them.

In a sense the apple tree is not unlike a business organisation putting
considerable effort and energy into producing attractive products for
people to use and thereby expose them to advertising. Could we stop the
advertising from falling on fertile ground but keep the attractive
products, nurture them, multiply them?
