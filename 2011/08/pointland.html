        <p>An excerpt from math adventure <cite>Flatland. A Romance of Many Dimensions</cite> (1884):</p>


<p><figure class="quotation"></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Behold yon miserable creature. That Point is a Being like ourselves, but confined to the non-dimensional Gulf. He is himself his own World, his own Universe; of any other than himself he can form no conception; he knows not Length, nor Breadth, nor Height, for he has had no experience of them; he has no cognizance even of the number Two; nor has he a thought of Plurality; for he is himself his One and All, being really Nothing. Yet mark his perfect self-contentment, and hence learn this lesson, that to be self-contented is to be vile and ignorant, and that to aspire is better than to be blindly and impotently happy. Now listen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He ceased; and there arose from the little buzzing creature a tiny, low, monotonous, but distinct tinkling, as from one of your Spaceland phonographs, from which I caught these words, &ldquo;Infinite beatitude of existence! It is; and there is none else beside It.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(&hellip;)</p>

<p>&ldquo;It fills all Space,&rdquo; continued the little soliloquizing Creature, &ldquo;and what It fills, It is. What It thinks, that It utters; and what It utters, that It hears; and It itself is Thinker, Utterer, Hearer, Thought, Word, Audition; it is the One, and yet the All in All. Ah, the happiness ah, the happiness of Being!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
