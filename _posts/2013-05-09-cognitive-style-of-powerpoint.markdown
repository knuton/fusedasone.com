In 2003 [Edward Tufte][1] published a controversial essay, entitled
[<cite>The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint</cite>][2] (CSPP), but directed
more generally towards the practice of basing presentations on
computer-aided slide-shows with information broken up into bullet-point
bites. Not a Luddite, but rather a true nerd about all things
information design, Tufte took offense with the dumbing down of content
necessary to fit it into PowerPoint slides, which, by [a popular
rule][3], may not contain more than seven bullet points.

Ten years have passed since Tufte&lsquo;s essay first caused furor, and
technology as well as its use has changed a lot. A reevaluation of the
theory and practice of computer-aided presentations could touch on many
things: the benefits of higher screen and projector resolutions,
allowing for an increase in information density; the impact of
Tufte&lsquo;s essay on software vendors and slide-show scholars; the
advent of new tools and paradigms such as [Prezi][4], or, within the web
development sphere, browser-based solutions such as [deck.js][5].

I hope that some of these analyses have been or will be made, but want
to share some thoughts I had regarding advice given in CSPP. At many
points in the text, Tufte depicts the slide-show approach as a poor
choice. In the case of tabular or charted data this is mainly due to low
resolution, which could not be avoided, and high levels of visual noise,
which arguably could be avoided. In the case of textually provided
information, the necessity to break up arguments into bullet points was
seen as a purely technological barrier to providing information at an
adequate level of detail. Tufte&rsquo;s recommended remedy in most cases
was the use of a paper hand-out: Its much higher resolution would allow
for serious tables and graphs as well as unconstrained formulation of
sentences. As an important additional benefit, attendants of the
presentation would at least have partial control about their pace of
consumption of the provided information.  They could refer back to an
earlier table or argument, or even skip ahead to prime themselves on
upcoming points or the general argument structure. If anything, slides
should give a very general outline of the presentation, and provide
supporting material, such as <em>relevant</em> images or illustrations.

Obviously, computer-aided presentations are at least as prevalent as in
2003, and the paper hand-out has not caught on. It would be unusual to
encounter it today, especially at tech conferences. At best it would be
seen as a playful element, at worst as an anachronistic act and waste of
physical resources. And maybe rightly so. But I believe that the
omnipresence of mobile computing devices has &ndash; without much
conscious contributions on the part of the presenters &ndash; given
audiences many of the same benefits. For most of the topics presented
on, relevant data will be just a few Google queries away, in-depth
documentation will be canonically available, and referring back to
points mentioned earlier is generally possible.

While it is great that this development has been going on without any
reliance on the understanding and goodwill of presenters, the situation
could be better.  When presenting in slide-show format, can you

* tell the audience where to find your slides <strong>before</strong>
  the talk;
* provide links to sources of detailed data within the slides;
* prepare material specifically for attendants with mobile devices, if
  relevant data is not available in an adequate form;
* provide ways to follow up on leads you give in your talk, so that
  attendants can make a note of them before they are forgotten?

Interestingly, the team at Prezi seems to have [some of the same
thoughts regarding mobile devices][6], if not explicitly drawing a
connection to the same points in CSPP.
